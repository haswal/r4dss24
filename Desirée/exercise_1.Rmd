```{r}

```

In this report, we showcase the relationship between measurements taken of various penguin species in Antarctica. 

## Exploring the data

The `penguins` dataset was originally sourced from observations collected at the Palmer Station in Antarctica. The dataset is shown below. It contains **`r nrow(penguins)`** rows.

```{r}
penguins
``

### Inspecting missing values

At first glance, it appears that the dataset has some variables with missing values. Below we use the code chunk to explore which observations lack measurement for `body_mass_g`. Are there any other variables with missing values? 
  
```{r missing-values}
filter(penguins, is.na(body_mass_g))
```
